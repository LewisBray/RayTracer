# RayTracer
A ray tracer based off of the specification in the EdX computer graphics course.

Currently the basic triangle and ellipsoid intersections are in place with just
the ambient value for each shape being used for colouring. Next steps are to introduce lighting and recursion.

This requires FreeImage for creating the .png file but this hasn't been added to
the repository yet as I want to figure out what files are actually needed for
linking.
